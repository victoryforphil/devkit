# Alex Carter's DevitKit of Awesomeness

## About
This devkit contains boilerplate (not found in other, larger boilerplate projects) and "usefull" code snippits that I have either
found or developed over the years. Hopefully to avoid having to refind a stackoverflow article or make stealing code from
older projects less janky.

## Definitions:
**Boilerplate:** *Template files (usally int he form of a project folder) that
act as a beggining to a project. In concept these are fully working projects.*

**Snippits:** *Code snippits that are just meant to be copied and pasted. Often require a working enviorment or other code.*

## Whats in it?

- Javascript

### Type of Applications

### Notible Librarys

## Orgnaization

    - Type (Bots, Server, Math)
        - Snippits/Boilderplate
            - Content.js
